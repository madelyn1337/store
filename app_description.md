  - Has auto-crop black bar detection and HDR to SDR tonemap options
  - Can encode with x264 and x265 codecs

- **EDL Export Workflow**
  - Processes Edit Decision Lists for precise frame-accurate cuts
  - Supports every industry standard timecode format and frame rate
  - Performs automatic GOP (Group of Pictures) detection
  - Handles complex multi-segment exports with frame accuracy
  - Maintains audio sync across segment boundaries
  - Has auto-crop black bar detection and HDR to SDR tonemap options
  - Removes need for Premiere Pro Sequence Settings no matter the source

- **DMFS Integration**
  - Integrates with DebugMode FrameServer for frame-accurate exports
  - Handles virtual AVI file processing
  - Supports multi-threaded encoding
  - Maintains source quality through precise encoding parameters
  - Has auto-crop black bar detection and HDR to SDR tonemap options
  - Multiple different encoding presets for different workflows set through the registry
  - Full automation support
  - Removes need for Premiere Pro Sequence Settings no matter the source
  - Encodes are set based on users CPU cores and preset selected to not overload their system

### 2. System Resource Management
- **Real-time Monitoring**
  - Tracks CPU usage across all cores
  - Monitors memory utilization
  - Displays disk space across all mounted volumes
  - Updates dynamically with configurable refresh rates
  - Color-coded warnings for resource constraints

### 3. Video Analysis Tools
- **Automatic Black Bar Detection**
  - Frame analysis for letterbox/pillarbox detection
  - Statistical analysis for consistent crop values
  - Handles variable aspect ratios and FPS
  - Supports both progressive and interlaced content

- **HDR Detection and Processing**
  - Identifies HDR metadata in source files
  - Supports and can convert multiple HDR formats
  - Optional HDR to SDR tone mapping
  - Preserves color accuracy during conversion due to linear color space processing

### 4. Timeline Calculator
